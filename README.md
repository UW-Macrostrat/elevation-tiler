A prototype tile server that can overlay a local COG on a proxied global layer.

Right now, this is configured with environment variables:
```bash
# Local or cloud-stored COG to overlay
OVERLAY_DATASET=data/S23982E015994_S24407E016361_UM_DSM.tif
```

Eventually, we will extend and integrate this capability with other
tools.
